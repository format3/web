This module is cross-platform and can be used programatically, i.e. as a build step or in a postinstall script.

**The minimum version you should be running is 0.1.0.**


If you're experiencing issues please update to the newest version and run `ffbinaries clearcache`.


# Platforms

The following platform codes are available:

## Windows
**windows-32** (aliases: win, windows, win-32), **windows-64** (alias: win-64)

## Linux
**linux-32** (alias: linux), **linux-64**, **linux-armhf** (alias: linux-arm), **linux-armel**

## OS X
**osx-64** (aliases: mac, osx, mac-64)

You can use aliases as your platform code argument in both CLI and programatically.

# Included components

|          | Mac | Linux | Windows |
|----------|-----|-------|---------|
| ffmpeg   | v   | v     | v       |
| ffprobe  | v   | v     | v       |
| ffserver | v   | v     |         |
| ffplay   | v   | v*    | v       |

(* Only linux-32 and linux-64 builds are available for ffplay)

# Usage

You can run it from your code or through CLI.

If `output` argument is specified the binary will be placed there.
In CLI it will default to current working directory.
Programatically the default is the also the working directory.

If `platform` argument is missing then the current platform will be autodected and binaries for it will be downloaded.

If `components` argument is missing then binaries of all available components will be downloaded (see [Included components](#included-components) section).


## CLI

When installed globally with `npm i ffbinaries -g` this module will register
itself on command line interface.

### Arguments

CLI uses the following syntax: `ffbinaries [platform] [--components] [--output] [--quiet]`

### Examples

```
ffbinaries
ffbinaries mac
ffbinaries win-64 --quiet --components=ffplay
ffbinaries linux-64 -q --v=3.2 --c=ffmpeg,ffprobe --output=/home/user/ffmpeg
```

There are also `ffbinaries help`, `ffbinaries versions` and `ffbinaries clearcache`.


## Programatically

### Methods

`ffbinaries` library exports the following methods:

* `downloadFiles(platform, opts, callback)` downloads and extracts the requested binaries.

   The `opts` parameter is an object that can contain these optional parameters:
      * `destination`: the path where the binaries will be downloaded to. If not provided it will default to `.`.
      * `components`: an array of string values that describes which [components](#included-components) to download. If not provided it will default to all components available for the platform.
      * `version`: version of ffmpeg to download
      * `quiet`: suppress verbose logs

* `getVersionData(version, callback)` fetches the full data set without downloading any binaries.

* `listVersions(callback)` returns the list of available versions from the API

* `listPlatforms()` returns the list of available platforms

* `detectPlatform()` returns the platform code of the machine as detected by the module.

* `resolvePlatform(input)` resolves input to a platform code (matches aliases).

* `clearCache()` purges local cache


### Examples

```
var ffbinaries = require('ffbinaries');
var platform = ffbinaries.detectPlatform();
var dest = __dirname + '/binaries';

ffbinaries.downloadFiles(function () {
  console.log('Downloaded binaries for ' + platform + '.');
})

ffbinaries.downloadFiles('linux', function () {
  console.log('Downloaded binaries for linux.');
})


ffbinaries.downloadFiles('win-64', {components: ['ffprobe'], quiet: true, destination: dest}, function () {
  console.log('Downloaded ffprobe binary for win-64 to ' + dest + '.');
})
```
